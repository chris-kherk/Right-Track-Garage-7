                <h3>Step-by-Step Repair Tips</h3>
                <h4>Assessing the Situation</h4>
                <p>
                    The first step in repairing a garage door that is not functioning properly is assessing the situation. Perform a visual inspection of the door and tracks to identify any obvious issues. Look for obstructions or damage in the tracks that may be causing the problem.
                </p>
                <h4>Realigning the Door</h4>
                <p>
                    Once you've assessed the situation, it's time to realign the door. To safely lift the door back onto the track, you may need a friend to help. Ensure both of you are positioned safely, then gently lift the door and guide it back into place. After it's back on track, check the alignment by opening and closing the door to ensure it operates it smoothly.
                </p>
                <h4>Replacing Rollers and Hardware</h4>
                <p>
                    If you notice signs that the rollers need replacement-such a squeking noises, difficulty in movement, or visible wear-it's time for a replacement. To replace the rollers, first, remove the old ones by unscrewing the hardware and holding them in place. Then, install the new rollers following the manufacturer's instructions, ensuring they fit securely.
                </p>
                <h4>Cleaning and Lubricating the Tracks</h4>
                <p>
                    Regular maintenance can prevent future issues with your garage door. Cleaning and lubricating the tracks is an essential part of this process. Use a cloth to wipe away dirt and debris from the tracks, and then apply a lubricant specifically designed for garage doors. This practice helps ensure smooth operation and reduces the likelihood of off-tracking incidents.
                </p>
                <h3>Preventative Measures to Avoid Future Issues</h3>
                <h4>Regular Maintenance Routines</h4>
                <p>
                    Establishing a regular maintenance routine is vital for keeping your garage door in good shape. Schedule inspections every few months to check for any signs of wear and tear and ensure your door remains aligned and functional.
                </p>
                <h4>Importance of Inspections and Adjustments</h4>
                <p>
                    Regular inspections allow you to catch potential problems early. If you notice any misalignment or issues with rollers, address them immediately to prevent an off-track situation.
                </p>
                <h4>Tips for Safe Usage to Minimize Off-Tracking Incidents</h4>
                <p>
                    Follow some safe usage tips to minimize the chances of your garage door going off-track. Avoid slamming the door open or closed, and be cautious about the weight you place on it or the force you use. By being mindful, you can help ensure your garage door remains in its tracks.
